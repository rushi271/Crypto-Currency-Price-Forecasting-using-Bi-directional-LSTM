# Crypto-Currency-Price-Forecasting-using-Bi-directional-LSTM
Developed a Streamlit web app using LSTM algorithm to predict future prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum with 85% accuracy. Utilized PyTorch and TensorFlow for model development, improving prediction precision by 20% through
hyperparameter tuning. Implemented real-time data visualization with Matplotlib and Plotly, enabling interactive crypto price forecasting
